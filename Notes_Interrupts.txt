When using the 32-bit timer with the PIC32, you must configure the bits for Timer2 and/or Timer4 accordingly. 

For example:

T2CONbits.T32 = 1; // Initialize 32-bit timer

The PRx value is set by the even numbered Timer, as well as the starting count. 

For example:

PR2 = 80000000; // 80,000,000 ticks = (PR1 + 1) * 1 <-- Prescalar
TMR2 = 0; // Initialize count to 0

However, the interrupt will be tripped by the odd numbered Timer. So those bits must be the one that are enabled.

For example:

IPC3bits.T3IP = 6; // Priority level 6 (SRS)
IPC3bits.T3IS = 0; // Don't care about the subpriority level
IFS0bits.T3IF = 0; // Clear flag for Timer2
IEC0bits.T3IE = 1; // Enable Timer2 interrupt

ANOTHER NOTE:

The PBCLK runs at 80 MHz.
